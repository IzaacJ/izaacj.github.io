For years I've been using WordPress for pretty much everything, including my personal site, and it has been working great. My professional experience with it made it my go-to for pretty much any website project.

My personal WordPress site has been hosted in my homelab for almost 4 years with some downtime while we were moving and during some maintenance.
But I moved it from my homelab to the cloud, Oracle Cloud to be specific, a few months ago due to planning some major work on my whole homelab setup.

And it ran there, without issues, until a few weeks ago. It unexpectedly went offline, and my ssh-key didn't get me into the instance either. And for some reason even the Cloud Shell failed to give me access to my instance, and for maybe a week or two I tried to get into my instance to troubleshoot, but without success.

So, I started looking into alternatives, specifically static alternatives that could preferably be hosted on GitHub. And I ended up with Jekyll, since it's integrated into GitHub Pages.

Took me some time to get familiar with it and to get the look I was aiming for, but I think I'm there now. Some things might get changed over time, but it seems to work as I want it to, at least for now.
